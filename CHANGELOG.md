## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-10

Initial release.

### Added

- Session ledger (`gatekit/ledger.py`) tracking output language, active
  pipeline, question budget, declared write scopes, and stop-hook state
  per `session_id`.
- Four-state verdict vocabulary (`ok / warn / fail / unverified`) and
  aggregation rules (`gatekit/verdict.py`).
- Output language detection (`gatekit/lang.py`) — Hangul-ratio based
  `ko`/`en` classification, with `ko`/`en` templates and Korean never
  the default.
- Hash-anchored approvals (`gatekit/approval.py`) for spec files.
- Executable completion contracts (`gatekit/contract.py`) derived from
  `gatekit-criterion` fenced blocks in `spec/05-gate.md`, run under a
  45-second total budget with per-criterion timeouts.
- Task and criterion parsing from fenced JSON blocks in `spec/*.md`
  (`gatekit/spec.py`).
- Job runner and worker backends (`gatekit/jobs.py`, `gatekit/workers.py`)
  supporting the Claude CLI by default and an optional Codex backend,
  with per-task write-scope enforcement via `GATEKIT_TASK_ID`.
- Five hook gates (`prompt`, `write`, `spawn`, `question`, `stop`) wired
  through `plugin/hooks/hooks.json`, each exiting 0 on internal error and
  logging to `.gatekit/runs/hook-errors.log`.
- Seven-axis doctor diagnosis (`gatekit/doctor.py`).
- Eight commands: `/gatekit:interview`, `/gatekit:mockup`,
  `/gatekit:tasks`, `/gatekit:gate`, `/gatekit:build`, `/gatekit:verify`,
  `/gatekit:doctor`, `/gatekit:setup`.
- CI gates (`tools/gate_*.py`) enforcing no absolute personal paths, skill
  and command size limits, a 1 MB blob-size cap, forbidden execution-step
  phrases in skills, manifest/hook/CHANGELOG consistency, and README ↔
  command-list sync, run on Python 3.9 and 3.12.
- `bin/gatekit.py` launcher so every command runs the kernel from the user's project directory; `tools/gate_command_invocations.py` fails CI on any invocation form that cannot run there.
- Doctor axis 2 reads `installed_plugins.json` and `settings.json` structurally: installed-but-disabled is `fail`, not `ok`.
- `plugin.json` does not list `hooks/hooks.json`; Claude Code loads it automatically and a duplicate reference fails plugin load. `tools/gate_manifest.py` rejects the duplicate.
